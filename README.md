Spacefinder UI
==============

This repository contains a version of the UI for the Cambridge Spacefinder application (https://spacefinder.lib.cam.ac.uk/). It has been built to investigate possibilities for development of the application to make it usable in other higher education contexts.

The major change made to the original application (https://github.com/cambridge-collection/spacefinder/) is the decoupling of the application into User Interface and server-side components. Here, the data for all spaces is served as a single JSON file rather than using a data endpoint driven by a server-side application.
